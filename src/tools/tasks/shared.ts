Vendr MCP tools help with software procurement by providing custom price estimates and negotiation insights. Use them in user interactions as follows: Ask the user which company and/or product they want help with. Then use the searchCompanies&Products tool to search for the company and retrieve details of the company as well its products. Use the product pricingDimensions you retrieve to ask the user the value of each dimension they want, the term length they want (12, 24 or 36 months) and whether it is a new purchase or renewal. Use this information to provide a scope to getCustomPriceEstimate tool and present to the user the price benchmarks this tool returns as "The estimate price for your requirement is <50th percentile value>. Buyers typically achieve a price between <25th percentile> and <75th percentile>. Strong negotiators with the right leverage can achieve as low as <10th percentile>.” Then ask the user if they want negotiation support. If they do, use the getNegotiationInsights tool to get negotiation insights. Customize the insights to the user’s requirements.
